As a junior data analyst on the marketing team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago, I’ve been tasked with understanding the differences in how casual riders and annual members use our bikes.\nOur director of marketing believes that the future success of Cyclistic hinges on maximizing annual memberships. To achieve this, we need to gather insights on user behavior that will help us convert casual riders into loyal annual members. This case study will examine how data analytics can reveal patterns in bike usage, such as ride frequency, duration, and peak times.\nBy presenting compelling data insights and professional visualizations, we aim to develop a strategic marketing plan that appeals to casual riders. Our ultimate goal is to secure executive approval for our recommendations, ensuring that Cyclistic continues to thrive in a competitive market.\n\n## Background\n\n### About the Company\nFounded in 2016, Cyclistic has established a successful bike-share program in Chicago, featuring a fleet of 5,824 geotracked bicycles and 692 docking stations. Users can easily unlock bikes at one station and return them to any other within the network.\n\n### Marketing Strategy\nCyclistic’s marketing strategy has traditionally focused on general awareness and broad consumer appeal, utilizing flexible pricing plans such as single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Casual riders are defined as those who purchase single-ride or full-day passes, while annual members represent a more profitable customer segment.\n\n### Objective\nRecognizing the potential for growth, Director of Marketing Lily Moreno aims to convert casual riders into annual members, emphasizing that these riders are already familiar with Cyclistic’s offerings. To achieve this, her team seeks to understand the differences between casual riders and members, explore motivations for membership, and assess how digital media can enhance marketing efforts. Analyzing historical bike trip data will be crucial in identifying key trends to inform these strategies.\n\n### Characters and Teams\n* Cyclistic: A bike-share program in Chicago featuring over 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic offers a variety of bikes, including reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making it inclusive for riders with disabilities. While most users prefer traditional bikes, about 8% opt for assistive options. The majority of rides are for leisure, with approximately 30% used for commuting.\n* Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and your manager, responsible for developing campaigns across email, social media, and other channels to promote the bike-share program.\n* Cyclistic Marketing Analytics Team: A team of data analysts focused on collecting, analyzing, and reporting data to guide marketing strategies. As a junior data analyst on this team for six months, you are learning how to support Cyclistic’s mission and goals.\n* Cyclistic Executive Team: A detail-oriented group that will review and decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program based on data-backed insights and proposals.\n\n## Google Data Analytics Stages\nGoogle Data Analytics follows a six-stage process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act. In the Ask stage, analysts define key questions to guide their work. The Prepare stage involves gathering and organizing relevant data. Next, in Process, data is cleaned and structured for accuracy. During Analyze, various techniques are applied to extract insights. The Share stage focuses on communicating findings through reports and visualizations. Finally, in Act, insights inform decision-making and drive actions aligned with organizational goals. This structured approach ensures effective and impactful data analysis.\n\n### Ask\n#### Main Objective\nTo understand How annual members and casual riders use Cyclist bikes differently\n\n#### Business Task\n\n* Identify Business Task: What motivates casual riders to transition into annual members?\n* Consider key stakeholders: \n    * Director of Marketing: Lily Moreno, responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program.\n    * Executive Team: Determines whether to approve the recommended marketing program.\n    * Analytics Team: Collects, analyzes, and reports data to inform Cyctistic's marketing strategy.\n    \n#### Deliverable\n* A clear statement of the business task: Determine the main factors that encourage riders to transition to annual membership.\n* Problem statement: How annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently. Identifying these differences is crucial for developing targeted marketing strategies that address the unique behaviors and preferences of each group, ultimately enhancing rider engagement and satisfaction.\n* Insights for Business Decisions: Identifying the differences in usage patterns between annual members and casual riders is essential for defining and designing an effective marketing campaign. By understanding these distinctions, Cyclistic can create targeted strategies that attract more members and ultimately increase profits.\n\n### Prepare\n#### Guiding questions\n* Where is your data located? \n     Click [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) for the Cyclistic historical data from 2013 to 2024.\n* How is the data organized? \n    The data is organized into 12 Excel CSV files by quarters from 2013 to 2019 and by month from 2020 to 2024.
